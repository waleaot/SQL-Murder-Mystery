/*
Here is the objective. 

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. <br>
The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. <br>
You vaguely remember that the crime was a *murder* that occurred sometime on *Jan.15, 2018* and that it took place in *SQL City*. <br>
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

A step-by-step approach to solving the SQL murder mystery. 

We start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

```
 
 select * 
   from crime_scene_report
   where crime_type = 'murder'
   and
   city = 'SQL City'
   and 
   date = 20180115
```

This is the output of the query:



-- So we start by looking at the crime scene report table

select *
from crime_scene_table
where crime_type = 'Murder'
      and city = 'SQL City';
