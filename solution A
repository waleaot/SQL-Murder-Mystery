###Here is the objective. 

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. <br>
The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. <br>
You vaguely remember that the crime was a *murder* that occurred sometime on **Jan.15, 2018** and that it took place in *SQL City*. <br>
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

A step-by-step approach to solving the SQL murder mystery. 

We start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

```
 
 select * 
   from crime_scene_report
   where crime_type = 'murder'
   and
   city = 'SQL City'
   and 
   date = 20180115;
```

This is the output of the query:

Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses.
The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".


Next, we would use the hints from the statements above to get the bigger picture.

-- Investigating who the first witness is. 

```

select * from person
     where address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
	 order by address_number desc
	 limit 1;

```


Witness 1 is: 14887 Morty Schapiro with person ID 14887


Investigate witness number 2:

```
select * 
    from person
	where name like '%Annabel%'
	and address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave';


```
The second witness is: Annabel Miller person ID 16371 

Having known the identity of these witnesses, we can proceed to the transcripts (Interview) table to see what they had said at the police station.

```
select *
  from interview
  where person_id in (16371,14887);
```

Here are the transcripts:
Morty Schapiro: I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a **"Get Fit Now Gym"** bag. <br>
                The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. <br>
                 The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".



Annabel Miller: I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.


These transcripts are going to help us trace the killer. 

```
  
 select * 
   from get_fit_now_member
    where id like '48Z%'
	and membership_status = 'gold'

intersect

 select * 
   from get_fit_now_member
   where id in ( select membership_id
			   from get_fit_now_check_in
			   where check_in_date = 20180109);
```


Combining the statements of the witness in relation to the gym membership records, 
the suspects are narrowed down to 2 persons:
Joe Germuska with person ID 28819
and Jeremy Bowers with person ID 67318

We would now use the other information given by Morty Schapiro in relation to the guy the killer drove away in.

```
 select * from person
 where id in (28819,67318)
 
 intersect 
 
 select * from person
 where license_id in ( select id 
 			from drivers_license 
 			where plate_number like '%H42W%');

```
Jeremy Bowers with person ID 67318 is the culprit. 


NB: I have used sub-queries and query combinations in the last 2 queries.
It is easy to understand if you run the queries separately and see what had gone in the background. 
to check for answers

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, "Insert the name of the person you found here");

SELECT value FROM solution;


<h4> Part 2 </h4>
<h6> Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... 
If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime.
If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries.
Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.
</h6>


## We would answer this question using just 2 queries. 

First, let's hear Jeremy's statement.

```
select * 
  from interview;

```

He said: "I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017."


Let's get Jeremy's sponsor. 
```
select *  
    from person
	where license_id in ( select id 
    					from drivers_license
						where height between 65 and 67
						and 
						hair_color = 'red'
						and 
						car_make = 'Tesla'
						and
						car_model = 'Model S')
						
intersect 

select * from person 
where id in ( select person_id
   from facebook_event_checkin
   where event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert');
```
There we go! 
Miranda Priestly is the person of interest.
