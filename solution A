/*
Here is the objective. 

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. <br>
The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. <br>
You vaguely remember that the crime was a *murder* that occurred sometime on *Jan.15, 2018* and that it took place in *SQL City*. <br>
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A step-by-step approach to solving the SQL murder mystery. 

We start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

```
 
 select * 
   from crime_scene_report
   where crime_type = 'murder'
   and
   city = 'SQL City'
   and 
   date = 20180115
```

This is the output of the query:

Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses.
The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".


Next, we would use the hints from the statements above to get the bigger picture.

-- Investigating who the first witness is. 

```

select * from person
     where address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
	 order by address_number desc
	 limit 1

```


Witness 1 is: 14887 Morty Schapiro with person ID 14887


Investigate witness number 2:

```
select * 
    from person
	where name like '%Annabel%'
	and address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'


```
The second witness is: Annabel Miller person ID 16371 

Having known the identity of these witnesses, we can proceed to the transcripts (Interview) table to see what they had said at the police station.

Here are the transcripts:
Morty Schapiro: I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a *"Get Fit Now Gym"* bag. <br>
                The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. <br>
                 The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
