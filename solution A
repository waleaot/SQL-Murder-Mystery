/*
Here is the objective. 

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. <br>
The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. <br>
You vaguely remember that the crime was a *murder* that occurred sometime on *Jan.15, 2018* and that it took place in *SQL City*. <br>
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.

*/

-- so we start by looking at the crime scene report table

select *
from crime_scene_table
where crime_type = 'Murder'
      and city = 'SQL City';
